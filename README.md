# CuratedSystemImages.jl

This Julia package provides access to several pre-built system images curated
collections of third-party Julia packages baked into the image.

It is an unregistered package and will remain this way since no package should
include this package in it's dependencies. To install use Julia's `Pkg` mode:

```
(@v1.7) pkg> add https://github.com/MichaelHatherly/CuratedSystemImages.jl
```
